Behavioral economics and quantitative analysis use many of the same tools of technical analysis, which, being an aspect of active management, stands in contradiction to much of modern portfolio theory. The efficacy of both technical and fundamental analysis is disputed by the efficient-market hypothesis, which states that stock market prices are essentially unpredictable, and research on whether technical analysis offers any benefit has produced mixed results\".*\n",
    "\n",
    "*In short, it means that if you use TA, you believe that there are some patterns in ways people buy and sell shares and you can find these patterns by looking at the:*\n",

    "*- **prices** (how much a share costed)*\n",
    "\n",
    "*- and **volume** (how many shares were sold/bought)*\n",
    "\n",
    "*from the past (let's say 3/7/14/28 minutes/hours/days). It might be true, it might not. A lot of people use it, some use it with other types of analysis, some without. You need to learn for your own what's best for you.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Technical analysis uses for example:*\n",

    "*- candlestick patterns,* \n",

    "*- chart patterns,*\n",

    "*And technical indicator, according to Wikipedia is: \"a mathematical calculation based on historic price, volume, or (in the case of futures contracts) open interest information that aims to forecast financial market direction. Technical indicators are a fundamental part of technical analysis and are typically plotted as a chart pattern to try to predict the market trend. Indicators generally overlay on price chart data to indicate where the price is going, or whether the price is in an \"overbought\" condition or an \"oversold\" condition.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "*There are thousands of technical indicators, like RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic, Moving Average, Parabolic SAR, CCI, ATR, ROC, OBV, Super Trend, Donchian Channel, etc.*\n",

    "*There are several ways of dividing technical indicators.*\n",

    "*For now, the most important thing for you is to understand that you should use them wisely and differentiate them if you want to use more than one (and you definitely should want to use more than one). By differentiation I mean, for example, use one lagging and one leading, one that shows you the trend, one that tells you about momentum, etc., and you should be sure that the indicators you use don't tell you all about the same aspect (like, you might use 5 indicators regarding momentum, but still know nothing about trend, volatility or volume, and because of that you might not get the correct picture of what's going on in the market, and lose money instead of earning them). Ok. I believe you know what I mean.*\n",

    "*Now. The RSI.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The RSI ('relative strength index') is one of the technical indicators people use in technical analysis.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The RSI is one of the most popular indicators. It can be used on it's own, but most people use it with other indicators to see the bigger picture.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*According to Wiki: \"The relative strength index (RSI) is a technical indicator used in the analysis of financial markets. It is intended to chart the current and historical strength or weakness of a stock or market based on the closing prices of a recent trading period. The indicator should not be confused with relative strength.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The RSI is classified as a momentum oscillator, measuring the velocity and magnitude of price movements. Momentum is the rate of the rise or fall in price. The RSI computes momentum as the ratio of higher closes to lower closes: stocks which have had more or stronger positive changes have a higher RSI than stocks which have had more or stronger negative changes.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The RSI is most typically used on a 14-day timeframe, measured on a scale from 0 to 100, with high and low levels marked at 70 and 30, respectively. Short or longer timeframes are used for alternately shorter or longer outlooks. High and low levels—80 and 20, or 90 and 10—occur less frequently but indicate stronger momentum.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The RSI provides signals that tell investors to buy when the security or currency is oversold and to sell when it is overbought\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "*And now one last thing about technical analysis: the oversold and overbought thresholds.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The thresholds are supposed to inform you that people sold too many shares or bought to many shares from the market for the market to carry on going in the same direction. If the condition is met, the market should change the course, so you might want to buy or sell your shares at that moment.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*The thresholds are there to tell you whether it's time to buy or sell according to all your calculations. And thus, they are only as good as your calculations. You can make the thresholds at 30 and 70, 40 and 60, 49 and 51 or even 1 and 99. It's all up to you. Just be careful with that, because sometimes the market can stay in that, so called, oversold or overbought condition for a long period of time, and the price could be still going down or up respectively.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*And that's why you could incorporate some other type of analysis or use other indicators to get the better picture.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*And that's it. Now you know enough to use the RSI and oversold and overbought thresholds for playing with 'paper account'. And you definitely don't know enough to invest real money (probably). If you want to use real money, read more, watch more, learn more about it.*\n",
    "\n",

    "And if you want, you can search Alpaca site for great videos regarding trading or you could wait for me to create another tutorial. I will do it, just don't know when, so you might want to subscribe to my YouTube channel and hit that bell button to get the notification. Although, I must tell you that not all my videos are about trading or programming, because what I'm here for is to help you improve yourself, improve your business, improve the world, to live and have fun, so my other videos might be about all that too.\n",
